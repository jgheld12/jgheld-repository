# About me
Hello!  My name is Jesse Held and I am currently a part-time distance student studying for my MSIT in the BIDA track.  I attended Undergrad at Ithaca College in upstate NY where I double-majored in Finance and Psychology.  After graduating, I worked on the trading floor at RBS for about a year before transitioning into consulting.  After 3 years of working in consulting, I knew I needed a change, so I enrolled at CMU in order to learn programming and analytics to try to get a job working for an NBA Front Office.  After my first year of studies at CMU, I decided to quit my consulting job and travel.  I spent the next year visiting a number of countries in Europe and Northern Africa, while occasionally flying back to the US to attend conferences and network.  At the end of my trip, I was extended an offer to intern with the Oklahoma City Thunder.  After working there for 9 months, I was able to find a full-time job with the Phoenix Suns and started as a Basketball Strategy & Research Analyst in September 2019.  After 6 months, I was promoted to manage the Basketball Strategy & Research team, which is my current full time job.  In my free time I enjoy reading, playing basketball, running, working out, and traveling.

# What I hope to learn
My job requires presenting analytical data to stakeholders who do not have a deep understanding of statistics and data analysis.  Because of this I need to make sure that my data visualizations are clean, accurate, and very easy to interpret.  In this class, I am hoping to learn tools and strategies to help my data visualizations have the most power and influence possible in my organization.  Even some simple charts that I have presented have required an education, but there will not always be the time or resources available to fully explain every visualization our group creates.  The more straightforward and simple we can make our charts, while still conveying all of the necesary information, the better.
