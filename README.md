# About me
Hello!  My name is Jesse Held and I am currently a part-time distance student studying for my MSIT in the BIDA track.  I attended Undergrad at Ithaca College in upstate NY where I double-majored in Finance and Psychology.  After graduating, I worked on the trading floor at RBS for about a year before transitioning into consulting.  After 3 years of working in consulting, I knew I needed a change, so I enrolled at CMU in order to learn programming and analytics to try to get a job working for an NBA Front Office.  After my first year of studies at CMU, I decided to quit my consulting job and travel.  I spent the next year visiting a number of countries in Europe and Northern Africa, while occasionally flying back to the US to attend conferences and network.  At the end of my trip, I was extended an offer to intern with the Oklahoma City Thunder.  After working there for 9 months, I was able to find a full-time job with the Phoenix Suns and started as a Basketball Strategy & Research Analyst in September 2019.  After 6 months, I was promoted to manage the Basketball Strategy & Research team, which is my current full time job.  In my free time I enjoy reading, playing basketball, running, working out, and traveling.

# What I hope to learn
My job requires presenting analytical data to stakeholders who do not have a deep understanding of statistics and data analysis.  Because of this I need to make sure that my data visualizations are clean, accurate, and very easy to interpret.  In this class, I am hoping to learn tools and strategies to help my data visualizations have the most power and influence possible in my organization.  Even some simple charts that I have presented have required an education, but there will not always be the time or resources available to fully explain every visualization our group creates.  The more straightforward and simple we can make our charts, while still conveying all of the necesary information, the better.

# Government Debt Flourish #2

Below is a chart that allows you to see the change in Debt-to-GDP ratio for a number of countries from 1995 to 2018 and how that change compares to other countries

## Differences in Government Debt Visualizations

Each of these visualization has their place, as they all allow the reader to see different aspects of the data easier than the others.  In the first chart (barchart), this data allows the reader to easily see how each individual country's current Debt-to-GDP ratio compares with the other countries.  It is easy to identify a single country to highlight and see where it falls among the other countries in the data.  The second chart (sparklines) is great for visualizing how a country's Debt-to-GDP ratio has changed over time.  Using this chart, the reader can easily see how any country's ratio has progressed from 1995-2018.  I chose the last visualization (dot plot), because I wanted the reader to be able to visualize something that isn't immediately apparent in the other 2 charts.  What is easy to view at first glance at this chart is the relative change in Debt-to-GDP ratio between countries from 1995-2018 as well as where they currently stand against each other.  Looking at this chart, it is clear that Japan has had the largest increase and currently has the highest ratio.  Conversely, it is easy to see that Estonia has barely changed from 1995-2018 and has the lowest current ratio.
