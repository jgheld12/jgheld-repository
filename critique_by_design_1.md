# Process
When orinigally looking at this chart, I found it very difficult to visualize all of the key data at a glance.  Using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, I rated the visualization for Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aecthetics, and Engagement.  Some of the things I liked about the chart were that it is aesthetically pleasing, clearly highlights Tucson as the city of emphasis, and it is clearly visible that Tucson is ahead of the U.S. Average.  Although I thought the chart was aesthetically pleasing, I do not think it is the best way to present this data, especially when considering the target audience.  The alternating colors of the percentages around the dial are distracting, the varying sizes of the different spokes within the dial don't mean anything, the range of 22.0% to 44.0% seems arbitrary and could easily be manipulated to make Tucson look better or worse, and finally, Tucson's 10-year improvement in Four-Year College Attainment Rate fades into the background when it is one of the most important aspects of this visualization.

My next steps were to try and think about how to improve upon this chart.  I decided that highlighting Tucson and Tucson only was important, as that is the key data point in this visualization.  Additionally, I wanted to make sure that the 10-year improvement jumped off the page, because a nearly 3% improvement in Four-Year College Attainment Rate is impressive and needs to be called out.  In thinking how to compare these data points against each other in a way that is clearly visible and also being able to show a change in percentage over time, I thought that a dumbell chart would be a good chart to visualize this.

I created a rough sketch of what the chart would look like and sent it to 2 people to review.  I selected one person in my target audience (an Arizona school teacher) and one person who has experience with data visualizations (former manager of data analysts).  I thought that the mix of these 2 perspectives would help to create a chart that is polished and understandable by the people that really need to understand it.
