## Differences in Government Debt Visualizations

Each of these visualization has their place, as they all allow the reader to see different aspects of the data easier than the others.  In the first chart (barchart), this data allows the reader to easily see how each individual country's current Debt-to-GDP ratio compares with the other countries.  It is easy to identify a single country to highlight and see where it falls among the other countries in the data.  The second chart (sparklines) is great for visualizing how a country's Debt-to-GDP ratio has changed over time.  Using this chart, the reader can easily see how any country's ratio has progressed from 1995-2018.  I chose the last visualization (dot plot), because I wanted the reader to be able to visualize something that isn't immediately apparent in the other 2 charts.  What is easy to view at first glance at this chart is the relative change in Debt-to-GDP ratio between countries from 1995-2018 as well as where they currently stand against each other.  Looking at this chart, it is clear that Japan has had the largest increase and currently has the highest ratio.  Conversely, it is easy to see that Estonia has barely changed from 1995-2018 and has the lowest current ratio.
