# The idea
## The project introduction and outline
I decided to do my project on public high school education in Phoenix and Tolleson, specifically when it comes to hispanic high school students in these areas.  These areas are predominantly hispanic and generally impoverished, and the students in these areas don't necesarily have all of the opportunities that other people have.  I chose this topic because Arizona is ranked 50th in the U.S. in public school education and many of the students who attent public school in Arizona don't have the resources available to attend college.  Most would be first generation college students, as less than 10% of all hispanic residents in Phoenix and Tolleson have a college degree.  There are programs available to mentor these students and help them go to college and I want to bring awareness to these programs and let people know that this is a major issue in Arizona.

I planned to discuss demographic information, educational attainment, poverty, and income in my assignment, as I believe all of these topics to be relevant to the main idea of college education providing a better life to these students.
