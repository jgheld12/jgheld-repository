# The idea
## The project introduction and outline
I decided to do my project on public high school education in Phoenix and Tolleson, specifically when it comes to hispanic high school students in these areas.  These areas are predominantly hispanic and generally impoverished, and the students in these areas don't necesarily have all of the opportunities that other people have.  I chose this topic because Arizona is ranked 50th in the U.S. in public school education and many of the students who attent public school in Arizona don't have the resources available to attend college.  Most would be first generation college students, as less than 10% of all hispanic residents in Phoenix and Tolleson have a college degree.  There are programs available to mentor these students and help them go to college and I want to bring awareness to these programs and let people know that this is a major issue in Arizona.

I planned to discuss demographic information, educational attainment, poverty, and income in my assignment, as I believe all of these topics to be relevant to the main idea of college education providing a better life to these students.

## The identified method and medium for your project
I chose to do my project in shorthand because I had never used it before and liked the examples shown in class.  I think it has good functionality and creates an interactive medium to really explore the topic.

For my charts, I chose to use Tableau.  I chose this because I know it is a powerful data visualization tool and I would like to expand my ability in using it.

## A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data
For my project, I used school rankings from wallethub.com and U.S. News and World Report.  For all of my charts, I utilized the 2018 American Community Survey, which is publically available date provided by the U.S. Government on topics such as education, demographics, poverty, and income.

I plan on using this data to paint a picture of disadvantage within the hispanic community in Phoenix and Tolleson.  These areas are relatively poor and lack the investment and resources needed to boost the kids up and help them get out of the cycle of poverty.  I also plan to use education and income data to show that a college education has a real impact on poverty and earnings to back up the fact that helping these students get into college will provide them with a better quality of life for them and their families.

## Design and user research
After deciding on my topic and gathering the data necessary, I began to design the project.  I mapped out a story arc in my head and then started to get it down on paper.  Once I had come up with a general outline for the project, I showed it to a friend who is a public school teacher in the Tolleson public school district, another friend who works with at-risk youth in Arizona for a non-profit, and finally with a Manager of a data analytics team. I chose these people because 2 of them represent my target audience and 1 of them would be a good resource for guidance on my data visualizations.

## User research protocol and findings
For my protocol for user research I sent each of my users my wireframes and a list of questions to go along with each page of the wireframe.  After getting their responses, I called each of them to talk through their responses and see how I could improve upon their feedback.

In my feedback, it was clear that all parties understood the topic and message I was trying to convey and most of the critiques were in how I was trying to convey that message.  Two of my charts confused my users, so I substituted those charts for simpler designs in the final project.  Additionally, I thought it would be helpful to set the stage before diving into the project, so I added some information on how poor public education is in Arizona for context.

## Revised design / wireframes based off of user research and a summary of findings.
Unfortunately, I did not have time to revise my wireframing before jumping into my final build of my project.  I did take time to think about my user feedback and made sure that the final project took all of the pertinent feedback into account.

## Final data story
[Final Project](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/jgheld_final_project/index.html)

My audience for the final project are people located in the Phoenix area who care about education and could be motivated to donate or volunteer for any of the programs that help mentor students.  One of the things that I did to appeal to this audience was utilize infographics by using Canvan that shows important information in a more fun and visualy appealing way.  As I built my project, thinking about how to fit a presentation into 60 seconds really helped me narrow my focus to the most important things.  I knew the final webpage could have more stuff on it that what I presented to the class, but thinking along those lines helped me stick to the most important information and avoid distracting fluff.

The first thing I before building my project in shorthand was create all of the visualizations I was going to use.  As I started to create the visualizations, I realized that some of the visualizations utilized the same formatting and could be overlayed to show key differences.  This process led to the decision to create the Hispanic vs. White High School Graduation and Bachelor's Degree Attainment charts used in my project.  Once I had completed all of my visualizations, I began putting those visulizations into Shorthand along with the corresponding text that helped to explain and emphasize key points.
