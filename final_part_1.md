## Intended Changes/Updates
I plan on changning the bubble chart on content page 2, because it didn't seem to effectively communicate what I was trying to communicate.  I need to make sure that my main purpose, which is providing people with available resources to help these students, is clear from the beginning.  I plan on adding more information about what the charts communicate, such as better titles/captions for those charts.
